# Lox-Interpreter
Interpreter(s) for Lox language as described in the book _Crafting Interpreters_ by Bob Nystrom.

Location for output of following Crafting Interpreters.

# JLox
Java Tree-Walk interpreter for the Lox language. Currently feature complete as per the book, along with some features designated in the book as 'challanges'. Planning on finishing more challanges along with adding test cases.

## Challanges
* Reverse Polish Notation Vistor for the Syntax Tree.
* _Continue_ and _Break_ statments implemented in loops. It is a syntax error to have them appear outside of any enclosing loop. Added non-syntatic suger version of 'for' loop in order to accomplish this.
